  description: |
    Dr. Yuxuan Liang is working on the research, development, and innovation of spatio-temporal data mining and AI, with a broad range of applications in smart cities. He obtained his PhD degree from School of Computing, National University of Singapore, supervised by Prof. Roger Zimmermann and Prof. David S. Rosenblum. He had three years of industrial experience in Microsoft, JD Technology, and Sea AI Lab, working closely with Dr. Yu Zheng and Dr. Junbo Zhang. He has published 100+ papers in refereed journals (e.g., TPAMI, AI, TKDE, TNNLS, TMC) and conferences (e.g., KDD, NeurIPS, ICML, ICLR, WWW). These publications have gathered ~7,000 citations on Google Scholar, with an h-index of 42. Among them, three papers were selected as the most influential IJCAI/KDD papers via PaperDigest. He was recognized as <a href="https://elsevier.digitalcommonsdata.com/datasets/btchxktzyw/7">Stanford/Elsevier Top 2% Scientists</a> in 2024, and 1 out of 10 most innovative and impactful PhD students focusing on Data Science in Singapore by <a href="https://sdsc.sg/fellowship/">Singapore Data Science Consortium</a> (SDSC) in 2020. He also received ACM SIGSPATIAL China Rising Star Nomination Award in 2024, and The 23rd China Patent Excellence Award in 2021. He has served as the Associate Editor of Neurocomputing (IF=6.0), the Area Chair for prestigious conferences such as KDD, MM, and ICASSP, and the Senior PC Member for IJCAI. He has also served as the organizer or co-chair of the Workshop on Urban Computing (Urbcomp@KDD), the Workshop on AI for Time Series (AI4TS@IJCAI/AAAI), and the Workshop on Mining and Learning from Time Series (MiLeTS@KDD). He has organized a series of tutorials on spatio-temporal data mining and time series analysis at prestigious conferences, such as KDD, WWW, AAAI, IJCAI, MM, and MDM. His research interests mainly lie in: 1) Spatio-temporal (ST) data mining: ST foundation models, Urban/ST + LLMs, AI for social good (e.g., urban, transportation, human mobility, environment, climate), physics-informed learning. 2) Urban computing: urban data sensing, urban data management, urban data analytics, urban decision-making. 3) Time series analysis: foundation models, forecasting, imputation, decomposition, anomaly detection. 4) Multimodal learning: multimodal fusion, vision-language models.
